The first project in the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree is titled "Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds." 
In this project, students are tasked with building a command-line application that uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images
of dogs and determine their breeds. The project involves implementing time functions, handling command-line arguments, processing image labels,
classifying images, and evaluating the performance of different models.
